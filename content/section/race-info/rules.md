1. All racers must be signed in at the Little Coal Creek Trailhead by **8:45 a.m.** Race start is at 9 a.m. We will NOT meet on race day at Byers Lake. Carpooling to Little Coal Creek is recommended. Please be aware of State Park parking and camping fees. If you stay at Byers Lake or in the area the night before, you are responsible for your transportation to the start.
2. Mandatory pre-race meeting **8:45 a.m.** Bibs need to be picked up by this time.
3. Bibs can not be transferred.
4. There is no early race start.
5. No one under 18 at the day of race is allowed to sign up.
6. All racers must check in with officials the morning of the race at Little Coal Creek, even if you picked up your bib the night before at Byers Lake Campground. We need to know who is starting so we can keep track of you.
7. Time cut-offs:
  - Full Traverse finish cut-off is 9 hours, or 6 p.m.
  - Full Traverse racers must reach the checkpoint just beyond Ermine Hill Trail junction by 1 p.m. (4 hours). Any racer arriving after 1 p.m. will be disqualified and their race bib pulled. Those who do not make the cut-off must take the Ermine Hill Trail down to the road. If someone chooses to go on despite this rule, they may be denied future Kesugi entry. Organizers will ensure a ride back to the finish from the Ermine Hill Trailhead.
  - To receive an official finish, Half Traverse racers must arrive within 4 hours.
8. **There are no aid stations.** There will be race official at midway and a trail sweep, but no refreshments provided on the course. You are responsible for your own food and water. Drink water along the course at your own risk. There are plenty of available streams, one of which is named Giardia Creek. Friends or family can meet you at Ermine Hill with gear and food.
9. Beware of wildlife and please do not wear headphones. Bears have been observed during the race and are common in this area. Moose are also prevalent.
10. Mandatory gear includes the following: windbreaker, long-sleeved shirt, pants or tights, hat, gloves, sustenance and water bottle. Please don't go "Crow Pass style" and duct tape everything together around your waist, thereby making it difficult to access. Also bring legitimate gear: no Tyvek painter's suit for your windbreaker and pants layer!
11. Stick to the trail and don't travel overland. Please do not cut the switchbacks. This especially applies to the Cascade Trail that heads down to Byers Lake.
12. **Do not litter!** And take care of your trash so it accidentally doesn't become litter.
13. Knowledge of the trail is vital. All racers are strongly advised to have traveled the course prior to race day.
