1. There are limited options for lodging. Camping at Byers Lake is recommended. Mary's McKinley View Lodge (mile 143.5 Parks Hwy) and Mt. McKinley Princess Lodge are close by. There are also numerous pull-outs where one can camp along the Parks Highway.
2. If you plan to leave your car at Little Coal Creek, we suggest not leaving any valuables in your car. Break-ins at State Park parking lots on main roads are common.
